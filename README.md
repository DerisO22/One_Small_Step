### CSI-370: Computer Architecture Final Project

### Technologies:
- WebAssembly
- React Three Fiber
- TypeScript
- Vite

### Goals:
1. Simulate a basic rocket launch into low-Earth orbit

2. Have webassembly do the majority of computation throughout the launch.

3. Have different mission phases/outcomes and provide the user with a debug menu to adjust values before launch. 

4. Get a surface level understanding of what the engineers and scientists at NASA had to figure out when creating the guidance systems for the Apollo missions.
